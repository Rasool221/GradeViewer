# GradeViewer

GradeViewer.py is a Python 3.x program that will
interact with the Canvas API to allow checking for grades
and students in your courses.

The purpose of this program is to have one place that will reduce clicks and time 
to check all of your grades at once and it will also allow you to
view all of the students in your course. This allows you to possibly form a 
study group or contact a student from a mutual class for help on assignments. This program 
also allows you to view assignments that are for a grade in your class. 

To use this script you will need to generate an API token from Canvas. Anyone is allowed to do
this and you can also set an expiration date on the token. Please keep in mind the expiration date you set
in order to not face problems in the future. *Do not share your token with anyone else*.

Feel free to modify or add on to this program and commit to a seperate branch. 
I will try to look over the changes and merge to master. 

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Python requests module

How to use:
Replace the constant variable "API_KEY" on the top of the code
to your generated token. Run the Python script and type "help" to get started.
